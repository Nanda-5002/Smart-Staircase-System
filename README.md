# Smart-Staircase-System
A motion-detected smart staircase lighting system using Arduino, IR sensors, and LDR

## Features
- Automatic motion-based lighting
- Night mode using LDR
- Energy optimization

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensors
- LDR Sensor
- LED strips


## How it Works
Developed an IoT-based smart staircase lighting system .
The system features two operational modes:
Automatic Mode – Lights turn on/off based on motion detected by IR sensors.
Night Mode – Lights activate only when ambient light is low (using LDR input).
The Arduino Uno handles real-time input from sensors and controls LED strips.
